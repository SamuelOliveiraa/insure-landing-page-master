# Frontend Mentor - Insure landing page

![Design preview for the Insure landing page coding challenge](/assets/design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## WELCOME! ðŸ‘‹

This is a challenge proposed by the website **[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)** and this site is great because it helps us improve our **coding skills** with real projects and more varied difficulties. The site gives us the possibility to train any skill or web technology that we want, be it media-querie, grid layout, Jquery, React, etc..

## The Challenge ðŸŽ¯

This challenge is to reproduce this **Insure landing page** as close as possible to the original design.

My biggest difficulties in this project was adjusting the image of the family at the beginning of the site, as I wasn't able to find a size or an ideal position for her. In this project I used Jquery to help me and facilitate the implementation of the burger menu that I created in another project, which will soon be here on GitHub.

## Technologies Used ðŸ§©

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JAVASCRIPT
* JQUERY
* Media-queries
